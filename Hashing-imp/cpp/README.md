# Hashing implementation using c++ STL

- Hashing in C++ can be implemented using different containers present in STL as per the requirement. Usually, STL offers the below-mentioned containers for implementing hashing:
1. set
1. unordered_set
1. map
1. unordered_map

## Set
- Some basic functions associated with Set:
begin() – Returns an iterator to the first element in the set.
end() – Returns an iterator to the theoretical element that follows last element in the set.
size() – Returns the number of elements in the set.
insert(val) – Inserts a new element val in the Set.
find(val) - Returns an iterator pointing to the element val in the set if it is present.
empty() – Returns whether the set is empty.
